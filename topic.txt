Performance evaluation of Traditional Machine Learning 
and Deep Learning  models for Automatic classification of Yoruba documents

*NLP*
As more and more information is stored and shared in the form of text files, it becomes difficult to analyze 
such large quantities of text data. Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks delve into the processing and 
analysis of text to extract information and insights. It consists of a wide range of tasks like text classification, 
natural language inference, machine translation, question answering, etc [27]. All these tasks are aimed at solving a 
particular problem and providing a better interpretation of natural language data.






By classifying text, we are aiming to assign one or more classes or categories to a document, making it easier to manage and sort. 
This is especially useful for publishers, financial institutions, insurance companies or any industry that deals with large 
amounts of content. An automatic document classification tool can realize a significant reduction in manual entry costs 
and improve the speed and turnaround time for document processing.

Why Semantic Intelligence is the best option for document classification?
Semantic technology processes and interprets content by relying on a variety of linguistic techniques including text mining, entity extraction, concept analysis, natural language processing, categorization and sentiment analysis. Semantic technology allows the automatic comprehension of words and entire documents, and understands the meanings of words in context.

As opposed to keyword and statistical technologies that process content as data, semantic technology is based on not just data, but the relationships between the data. This ability to understand words in context is what makes automatic classification possible, and enables not only the management of large volumes of data, but the ability to optimize it for even further analysis and intelligence.
