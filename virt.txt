Creating a virtual environment in python
using code: python -m venv venv on the terminal, automatically create a venv 


ctrl+shift+p   select python then select python 3.7 venv


Had a bit of issue installing scrapy at the start had to upgrade to the latest pip version using 
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

then i install scrapy again using pip install scrapy command


creating a python virtual environment
i run this command:: python -m venv venv
this will create a virtual environment named venv.

then command+shift+p choose python interpreter
then choose python venv

install scrapy

instantiate the project name:::
scrapy startproject postscrape

navigate into the name of the newly folder created which is postscrape in this case


navigate to the spider folder to create a new file

ctrl + z to exit the scrapy shell


NB: Always put quote around the url you are crawling



.get(): find the and return the first match

.getall() : find and return all the instance of the tag, text etc


looping through the document

converting to json files for the output involves
scrapy crawl posts -o posts.json



I was pushing my app into heroku when I accidentally exited out of my terminal while it was still running. I assumed that meant the process was over so I had to start all over. But when I tried to upload my app into heroku, it said

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue
I looked up on the internet to see how I could stop the previous process from running and the solution many people recommended was to type this code rm -f ./.git/index.lock but when I typed it, I got this error

Remove-Item : Parameter cannot be processed because the parameter name 'f' is ambiguous. Possible matches include: -Filter -Force.
At line:1 char:4
+ rm -f ./.git/index.lock
+    ~~


Solution: This really solved thhe whole problem, i think i have two repository instantiated
 at the same time so when i run git command it was confuse on which one to effect

Note:

17 >> 1 → 17 // 2 (17 floor-divided by 2 to the power of 1) → 8 
(shifting to the right by one bit is the same as integer division by two)
17 << 2 → 17 * 4 (17 multiplied by 2 to the power of 2) → 68 
(shifting to the left by two bits is the same as integer multiplication by four)

& does a bitwise and, e.g., x & y = 0, which is 0000 0000 in binary,
| does a bitwise or, e.g., x | y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,
˜  does a bitwise not, e.g., ˜ x = 240*, which is 1111 0000 in binary,
^ does a bitwise xor, e.g., x ^ y = 31, which is 0001 1111 in binary,

Scenario
In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:

take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;
if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 ÷ 2;
otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 × c0 + 1;
if c0 ≠ 1, skip to point 2.
The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.






Key takeaways: continued
Exercise 1

Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

for i in range(1, 11):
    # Line of code.
        # Line of code.


Check
Sample solution:
for i in range(0, 11):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)


Exercise 2

Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

x = 1
while x < 11:
    # Line of code.
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.


Check
Sample solution:
x = 1
while x < 11:
    if x % 2 != 0:
        print(x)
    x += 1


Exercise 3

Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ symbol, and print the part before @ on one line. Use the skeleton below:

for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org":
    if ch == "@":
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.


Check
Exercise 4

Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. The program should iterate over a string of digits, replace each 0 with x, and print the modified string to the screen. Use the skeleton below:

for digit in "0165031806510":
    if digit == "0":
        # Line of code.
        # Line of code.
    # Line of code.

Multidimensional nature of lists: advanced applications
Let's go deeper into the multidimensional nature of lists. To find any element of a two-dimensional list, you have to use two coordinates:

a vertical one (row number)
and a horizontal one (column number).
Imagine that you develop a piece of software for an automatic weather station. The device records the air temperature on an hourly basis and does it throughout the month. This gives you a total of 24 × 31 = 744 values. Let's try to design a list capable of storing all these results.

First, you have to decide which data type would be adequate for this application. In this case, a float would be best, since this thermometer is able to measure the temperature with an accuracy of 0.1 ℃.

Then you take an arbitrary decision that the rows will record the readings every hour on the hour (so the row will have 24 elements) and each of the rows will be assigned to one day of the month (let's assume that each month has 31 days, so you need 31 rows). Here's the appropriate pair of comprehensions (h is for hour, d for day):

temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]


The whole matrix is filled with zeros now. You can assume that it's updated automatically using special hardware agents. The thing you have to do is to wait for the matrix to be filled with measurements.

Now it's time to determine the monthly average noon temperature. Add up all 31 readings recorded at noon and divide the sum by 31. You can assume that the midnight temperature is stored first. Here's the relevant code:

temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

total = 0.0

for day in temps:
    total += day[11]

average = total / 31

print("Average temperature at noon:", average)


Note: the day variable used by the for loop is not a scalar - each pass through the temps matrix assigns it with the subsequent rows of the matrix; hence, it's a list. It has to be indexed with 11 to access the temperature value measured at noon.

Now find the highest temperature during the whole month - see the code:

temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

highest = -100.0

for day in temps:
    for temp in day:
        if temp > highest:
            highest = temp

print("The highest temperature was:", highest)


Note:

the day variable iterates through all the rows in the temps matrix;
the temp variable iterates through all the measurements taken in one day.
Now count the days when the temperature at noon was at least 20 ℃:

temps = [[0.0 for h in range(24)] for d in range(31)]
#
# The matrix is magically updated here.
#

hot_days = 0

for day in temps:
    if day[11] > 20.0:
        hot_days += 1

print(hot_days, "days were hot.")
