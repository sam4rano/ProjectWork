Creating a virtual environment in python
using code: python -m venv venv on the terminal, automatically create a venv 


ctrl+shift+p   select python then select python 3.7 venv


Had a bit of issue installing scrapy at the start had to upgrade to the latest pip version using 
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

then i install scrapy again using pip install scrapy command


creating a python virtual environment
i run this command:: python -m venv venv
this will create a virtual environment named venv.

then command+shift+p choose python interpreter
then choose python venv

install scrapy

instantiate the project name:::
scrapy startproject postscrape

navigate into the name of the newly folder created which is postscrape in this case


navigate to the spider folder to create a new file

ctrl + z to exit the scrapy shell


NB: Always put quote around the url you are crawling



.get(): find the and return the first match

.getall() : find and return all the instance of the tag, text etc


looping through the document

converting to json files for the output involves
scrapy crawl posts -o posts.json



I was pushing my app into heroku when I accidentally exited out of my terminal while it was still running. I assumed that meant the process was over so I had to start all over. But when I tried to upload my app into heroku, it said

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue
I looked up on the internet to see how I could stop the previous process from running and the solution many people recommended was to type this code rm -f ./.git/index.lock but when I typed it, I got this error

Remove-Item : Parameter cannot be processed because the parameter name 'f' is ambiguous. Possible matches include: -Filter -Force.
At line:1 char:4
+ rm -f ./.git/index.lock

Solution: This really solved thhe whole problem, i think i have two repository instantiated
 at the same time so when i run git command it was confuse on which one to effect
